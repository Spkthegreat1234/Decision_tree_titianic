# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction with Decision Tree 🌳

Welcome to the **Titanic Survival Prediction** project! This repository provides a simple yet powerful implementation of a decision tree model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. 🛳️


## 📚 About the Project

This project leverages Python and popular data science libraries to analyze the famous Titanic dataset. By building a decision tree classifier, we aim to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, and passenger class.

## 🧰 Features

- 🌟 **Decision Tree Classifier**: A straightforward machine learning model that is easy to interpret.
- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the Titanic dataset.
- 🔍 **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics to assess the model's accuracy.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-decision-tree.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd titanic-decision-tree
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `titanic_decisionTree_exercise.ipynb` and run the cells step by step.

### Example Output

The decision tree model predicts whether a passenger survived based on features like:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Passenger Class**

🎉 Results include visualizations, accuracy scores, and insights into feature importance.

## 📈 Results

- Achieved an accuracy of **X%** (update with your actual result).
- Key features influencing survival:
  - **Gender**: Women had a higher survival rate.
  - **Passenger Class**: First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
